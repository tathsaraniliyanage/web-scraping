<h1>Web scraping in python</h1>

<h2>How Web Scraping Works:</h2>
<li>Access the Website: You first send a request to a webpage using tools like Python's 
requests or urllib library to download the HTML content.</li>
<li>Parse the HTML: Once the HTML is retrieved, libraries like BeautifulSoup or lxml are 
used to parse the HTML content and extract specific data, such as titles, prices, or links.</li>
<li>Extract and Process Data: After parsing, you can navigate through the HTML structure
(such as finding tags by their class names or IDs) to extract the specific pieces of
data you're interested in.</li>
<li>Store the Data: After extracting the desired information, the data is usually stored in 
a structured format like CSV, JSON, or a database.</li>


<h2>Tools and Libraries Used for Web Scraping:</h2>
<li>Requests: Used to send HTTP requests to fetch web page content.</li>
<li>BeautifulSoup: A Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents to extract specific data.</li>
<li>Selenium: Used for web scraping dynamic content (web pages that load content with JavaScript).</li>
<li>Scrapy: A powerful framework for large-scale web scraping tasks.</li>
<li>Pandas: For organizing and storing the extracted data into structured formats like CSV or DataFrames.</li>
